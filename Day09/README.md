# Docker Swarm Secrets: Securely Manage Sensitive Data (Part 2)

**Introduction**

This repository complements Part 1 of the Docker Swarm series, focusing on secure management of sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, and more. By leveraging Docker Swarm secrets, you can separate sensitive information from your container images, enhancing the security posture of your applications.

**Understanding Docker Swarm Secrets**

Docker Swarm secrets allow you to store sensitive information outside of container images, preventing accidental exposure or unauthorized access. Secrets are managed as key-value pairs and can be referenced within your containers for secure access.

**Creating Secrets**

Here are two common methods to create Docker Swarm secrets:

**1. File-Based Secrets:**

   * Create a file containing your sensitive data. For example, create a file named `.credentials` and store your access keys and secret keys within it. Use your preferred text editor (e.g., `nano`) for this purpose.
   * Convert the file into a secret using the `docker secret create` command:

   ```bash
   docker secret create <secret_name> <file_path>
   ```

   Replace `<secret_name>` with a descriptive name for your secret (e.g., `aws_creds`) and `<file_path>` with the path to your created file (e.g., `.credentials`).

**2. Environment Variable Secrets:**

   * Define environment variables during container creation to provide secrets directly. This approach avoids creating separate files:

   ```bash
   docker run -e <environment_variable_name>=<secret_value> <image_name>
   ```

   Replace `<environment_variable_name>` with the desired variable name (e.g., `DB_PASSWORD`) and `<secret_value>` with your actual password.

**Mounting Secrets**

Once you've created your secret, you can mount it as an environment variable within your containers. This allows containers to access the secret securely:

1. Create a YAML file defining your service configuration. For example, create a file named `aws-cli.yml` and specify environment variables that reference the secret:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     aws-cli:
       image: <your_aws_cli_image>
       environment:
         AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:
           from_secret: aws_creds
         AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
           from_secret: aws_creds
       # ... other service configurations
   ```

   Replace `<your_aws_cli_image>` with the actual image name for your AWS CLI tool.

2. Deploy the service using the `docker stack deploy` command, referencing your YAML file:

   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c aws-cli.yml AWS
   ```

**Verifying Secrets**

1. Use `docker service ps` to check the status of your deployed service.

2. **Security Caution:**  For verification purposes, connect to a worker node (not the master node) to enhance security. This prevents accidental exposure of secrets on the master node.

3. Use commands like `env`, `aws s3 ls`, and `aws describe-vpc | jq` to verify that the container can access the secrets correctly.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Security Best Practices:**
    * Always use strong passwords and access keys.
    * Regularly rotate your secrets to minimize the risk of compromise.
    * Consider leveraging tools like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for more advanced secret management, especially in large-scale deployments.

* **Alternative Method (Optional):**
    This guide focuses on file-based secrets. You can also define placeholders for passwords directly within your YAML files. However, this approach is less secure as the passwords are stored in plain text within the YAML configuration. Always prioritize using secrets for sensitive data.
