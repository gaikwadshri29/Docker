# Docker Swarm Setup and Management

Welcome to the Docker Swarm Setup and Management guide! This guide will walk you through setting up a Docker Swarm cluster, deploying services, and managing the cluster with simple commands.

## Introduction

Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers. It allows you to manage a cluster of Docker engines as a single virtual system. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and manage your Docker Swarm cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on all nodes
- Access to multiple instances (machines or VMs)

## Setting Up Docker Swarm

### Steps

1. **Initialize Docker Swarm on the first node:** This command initializes the first node as the manager.

2. **Join worker nodes:** Use the worker join token on each worker node.

3. **Join manager nodes:** Use the manager join token on each additional manager node.

4. **Verify the setup:** Check the status of the Swarm and list all nodes to ensure they are correctly joined.

5. **Check networks:** View the networks available in the Swarm.

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize Docker Swarm on the first node
docker swarm init

# Join worker nodes
docker swarm join --token <worker-token> <manager-ip>:<manager-port>

# Join manager nodes
docker swarm join --token <manager-token> <manager-ip>:<manager-port>

# Check Swarm status
docker info

# List nodes
docker node ls

# Check networks
docker network ls
```

## Deploying Services

### Steps

1. **Deploy a sample service:** Create a service with 3 replicas and publish it on port 8000.

2. **Scale the service up and down:** Adjust the number of replicas for the service.

3. **Deploy service only on worker nodes:** Ensure the service runs only on worker nodes.

4. **Deploy a global service:** Run the service on every node.

### Commands

```bash
# Deploy a sample service
docker service create --name app1 --replicas 3 --publish 8000:80 kiran2361993/rollingupdate:v10

# Scale the service up
docker service scale app1=6

# Scale the service down
docker service scale app1=1

# Deploy service only on worker nodes
docker service create --name app1 --constraint node.role==worker --replicas 6 --publish 8000:80 kiran2361993/rollingupdate:v10

# Deploy a global service (runs on every node)
docker service create --name monitor --publish 9100:9100 --mode global prom/node-exporter

docker service create --name cadvisor --publish 8888:8080 --mode global google/cadvisor:latest
```

## Managing Services and Nodes

### Steps

1. **Check service tasks:** List the tasks of a service.

2. **Put a node in maintenance mode:** Drain the node to prevent it from running tasks.

3. **Reactivate a node:** Set the node back to active status.

### Commands

```bash
# Check service tasks
docker service ps app1

# Put a node in maintenance mode
docker node update <node-id> --availability drain

# Reactivate a node
docker node update <node-id> --availability active
```

## Load Balancing

To see load balancing in action, run the following command in a loop. This shows how requests are distributed across different nodes.

```bash
while true; do curl -sL http://<ip>:8000/ | grep -I 'IP-A'; sleep 1; done
```

## Visualizing the Cluster

Use Swarm Visualizer from GitHub to visualize your cluster. Access the visualizer at `http://<manager-ip>:8080`.

```bash
docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name swarm-visualizer -e HOST=<manager-ip> -e PORT=<manager-port> dockersamples/visualizer
```

## Conclusion

Docker Swarm makes it easy to manage a cluster of Docker containers. With these simple commands, you can set up, deploy, and manage services across multiple nodes. Happy clustering!
